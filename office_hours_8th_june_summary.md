# 📋 Office Hours – 8th June Q&A Summary

## 🧑‍🎓 Pastor Soto

### 1. **Form vs LLM for structured input (e.g., booking date)?**
> Use product thinking. Let the LLM pre-fill forms and allow user correction. Avoid janky UX — forms might help, but keep it natural.

### 2. **If I use a form, is that cheating on the homework?**
> No, but it may reduce the challenge. Push yourself — find edge cases and be critical. Homework is about practicing eval rigor.

### 3. **How close is the homework to real consulting?**
> Not very. Homework focuses on evals; real consulting involves org chaos, product ambiguity, people issues. Evals are just a tool.

## 🧑‍💼 dfahey

### 4. **How to convince stakeholders evals matter?**
> Most assume LLMs are magic. Show real-world breakdowns. Use examples to highlight failure and force attention on quality.

### 5. **What if teams don’t log outputs?**
> That's a problem. No logs = no improvement. Push for at least basic logging and sample reviews to kickstart eval work.

## 🧑‍💻 Joanna Leung

### 6. **How much eval time should be budgeted in MVP?**
> Start lean: basic error analysis + ~100 trace reviews. Scale as needed. Evals can be informal early on.

### 7. **Manual error analysis is painful. Is there a better way?**
> Yes — look for **theoretical saturation**. Build lightweight tools to streamline review. Stop when you stop learning from examples.

### 8. **How to express product readiness without hard numbers?**
> Categorize errors into failure modes. Quantify frequency (e.g., “X mode appears in 7% of traces”) and show examples.

### 9. **How to tie errors to risk like churn?**
> Don’t just count — assess impact. Rare but high-risk errors (e.g. leading to churn) should be called out explicitly.

### 10. *(Regression question not asked due to time)*

## 🧠 Robert Ta

### 11. **What question do you wish builders asked more?**
> Ask about underlying value and key risks, not just tooling. Focus on: “What breaks in real use? What really matters?”

### 12. **First principles for future AI builders?**
> - **Shreya**: Get good at qualitative error analysis + build tools to speed yourself up  
> - **Hamel**: Learn data science/stats — necessary beyond MVP stage

### 13. **Where do you get AI news?**
> - Twitter (esp. Hamel’s network)  
> - [Swyx’s AI newsletter](https://www.latent.space/)  
> - Han Lee’s blog/talks
